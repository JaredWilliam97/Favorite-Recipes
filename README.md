FAVORITE RECIPIES

Description:

- We created this app Favorite-Recipes utilizing a function for users to add and view their favorite recipes. When you go tot the app a user can sign up using their name, email address and password. Once logged in you are free to make any recipe you desire. The user is also able to see other recipes on the app as well. It will show the date in which they made the recipe to keep all the recipes in order from newest date to oldest date based on when the user created a recipe. They can make comments on other recipes that they like or do not like. The user can also delete their comments too!!

- In this project we have used everything we have learned in the past six units to create this full-stack application.

Usage

- We used Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. We used Handlebars.js as the template engine. WE used MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database. We used GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. We used a library where it show's emojis pass the screen when logging in. We used the folder structure using the MVC paradigm which made it easy to organize everything. We included authentication using express-session and cookies. We deployed this app using Heroku. Our user interface is sleek and made user friendly.
